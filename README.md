# 🚀 Venture Portfolio Manager (VPM)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Venture Portfolio Manager (VPM)** is a web-based system designed to help **venture studios** efficiently manage multiple startups within their portfolio.  
It provides a centralized platform where managers, founders, team members, and investors can track progress, resources, funding, and milestones — all in one place.  

The goal is to replace scattered spreadsheets and ad-hoc tools with a streamlined, role-based platform that ensures transparency, accountability, and better decision-making.
